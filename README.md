# React Task Tracker App

This project is a clone of [Brad Traversy's Crash Course Video](https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8). I am using this repository only for self-learning and to hold my notes.

## What is React?

* React is a library for building user interfaces.

* React runs on the client as a SPA (Single Page App), but can be used to build full stack apps by communicating with a server/API (eg. MERN stack).

* React is often referred to as a front-end “framework” because it is capable and directly comparable to a framework such as Angular or Vue.

## Why would you use React?

* Structure the “view” layer of your application

* Reusable components with their own state

* JSX - Dynamic markup

* Interactive UIs with Virtual Dom

* Performance & testing

* Very popular in the industry

## Working with state

* Components can have “state” which is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves.

* “App” or “global” state refers to state that is available to the entire UI, not just a single component.

* Prior to React 16.8, we had to use class based components to use state. Now we can use functional components with hooks.

## React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that let us hook into the React state and lifecycle features from function components.

* useState - Returns a stateful value and a function to update it

* useEffect - Perform side effects in function components

* useContext, useReducer, useRef - Beyond the scope of this course

You can also create your own custom hooks.
